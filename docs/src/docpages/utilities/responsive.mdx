## Breakpoints

```scss
// Small (sm) breakpoint.
@media (min-width: 576px) {
  /* ... */
}

// Medium (md) breakpoint.
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* ... */
}

// Large (lg) breakpoint.
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  /* ... */
}

// Extra large (xl) breakpoint.
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  /* ... */
}
```

## Responsive mixins

- You can set up properties that will only be applied in certain breakpoint.
- Include `amb-responsive-media()` mixin with the preferred breakpoint.
- Combine more than one breakpoints to achieve responsive design in multiple breakpoints.

```scss
@import '@amar-ui-web/responsive';

.SomeElement {
  // The rest of properties will be applied in all breakpoints unless overriden.

  @include amb-responsive-media('sm') {
    // Apply properties within 'sm' breakpoint here.
  }

  @include amb-responsive-media('lg') {
    // Apply properties within 'lg' breakpoint here.
  }
}
```
