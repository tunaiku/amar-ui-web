## Usage

In its most basic form, simply create `.Tips` class that contains the text you want to display.

```html preview=true
<div class="Tips">
  <p>What tips should the user know?</p>
</div>
```

## With Link

Simply add a link element as a child inside the .Tips wrapper class to add an actionable
call-to-action as needed.

```html preview=true
<div class="Tips">
  <p>What tips should the user know?</p>
  <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">With link</a>
</div>
```
