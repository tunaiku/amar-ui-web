Amar UI's naming conventions are highly influenced from SUIT CSS and is adapted from them. It relies
on structured class names and meaningful hyphens (i.e., not using hyphens merely to separate words).

## Core principles

Strictly adhere to the agreed-upon style guide listed below. The general principle is to develop
**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** SCSS, built around reusablity and maintainability.

- All code should look as if a single person has coded it.
- Don't try to prematurely optimize your code; keep it readable and understandable.
- When building a component, always start by looking at existing patterns.
- Break down complex components until they are made up of simple components.
- Save your complex components as patterns so they can be easily reused.
- Build your component as a mixin which outputs optional css.

## Components

Component classes are pieces that forms the entirety of an application. They are building blocks
that are normally **reusable**, which means that their usage aren't locked in just a single context
or page. You can think of components as custom elements that enclose specific semantics, styling,
and behaviour.

To write a component class, the complete syntax is `ComponentName(-partName|--modifierName)` which
is broken up into 3 pieces.

#### `ComponentName`

The component name must be written in **pascal case**.

```html
<div class="Button">...</div>
<div class="InputGroup">...</div>
```

#### `ComponentName-partName`

Parts live in the descendant nodes of a component and are integral pieces that form the entirety of
a component. Component parts must be written after a **single hyphen** and in `camelCase` syntax.

```html
<div class="Card">
  <div class="Card-header">
    <div class="Card-title">
      ...
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="Card-body">
    <p>...</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### `ComponentName--modifierName`

A component can have multiple modifiers; that is responsible in modifying the presentation of the
base component. Component modifiers must be written after **double hyphens** and in `camelCase`
syntax.

```scss
.Button { ... }
.Button--primary { ... }
```

```html
<button class="Button Button--primary"></button>
```

## Utilities

Utility classes can be used in any elements and contexts as you see fit; they can be used in
conjunction with component classes and can also be used together one another.

To write a utility class, follow the complete syntax of `ComponentName(-valueName)` which is broken
up into 2 integral parts.

#### `UtilityName`

The utility name should be written in `PascalCase`. These apply the **base or default value** of the
utility class. Utility name must convey the property or value that it wants to apply.

```css
.FontWeight {
  font-weight: regular;
}
```

```html
<div class="FontWeight">Applies the `font-weight: regular` which is the default weight.</div>
```

#### `UtilityName-value`

The utility value must be written after a **single hyphen** and in `camelCase` syntax. Utility
values can be alphanumerical.

```scss
// Font Weight
.FontWeight-bold { ... }

// Flex
.Flex { ... }
.JustifyContent-end { ... }
.AlignItems-end { ... }

// Grids
.Grid
.Grid-6 { ... }
```

```html
<div class="FontWeight-bold">I'm bold!</div>
<div class="Flex JustifyContent-end AlignItems-end">I'm aligned!</div>
<div class="Grid Grid-6">I'm a grid layout!</div>
```
