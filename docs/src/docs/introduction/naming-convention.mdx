title: 'Naming Convention'
description: "Amar UI's naming conventions are highly influenced from SUIT CSS and is adapted from them.
It relies on structured class names and meaningful hyphens (i.e., not using hyphens 
merely to separate words)."

## Principles

Strictly adhere to the agreed-upon style guide listed below. The general principle is to develop **DRY
(Don't Repeat Yourself)** SCSS, built around reusable components and patterns.

- All code should look like a single person has typed it.
- Don't try to prematurely optimize your code; keep it readable and understandable.
- When building a component, always start by looking at existing patterns.
- Break down complex components until they are made up of simple components.
- Save your complex components as patterns so they can be easily reused.
- Build your component as a mixin which outputs optional css.

## Components

Component classes are pieces that forms the entirety of an application. They are
building blocks that are normally **reusable**, which means that their usage aren't locked in just a
single context or page. You can think of components as custom elements that enclose specific semantics,
styling, and behaviour.

To write a component class, the complete syntax is `ComponentName(-partName|--modifierName)`
which is broken up into 3 pieces.

#### `ComponentName`

The component name must be written in **pascal case**.

```html
<div class="Button">...</div>
<div class="InputGroup">...</div>
```

#### `ComponentName-partName`

Parts live in the descendant nodes of a component and are integral pieces that form the entirety of
a component. Component parts must be written in **camel case** following a single hyphen.

```html
<div class="Card">
  <div class="Card-header">
    <div class="Card-title">
      ...
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="Card-body">
    <p>...</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### `ComponentName--modifierName`

A component can have multiple modifiers; that is responsible in modifying the presentation of the
base component. Component modifiers must be written in **camel case** following double hyphens.

```scss
.Button { ... }
.Button--primary { ... }
```

```html
<!-- Modifier to apply primary fill to a standard button -->
<button class="Button Button--primary"></button>
```

## Utilities

Utility classes can be used in any elements and contexts as you see fit; they can be
used in conjunction with component classes and can also be used together one another.

To write a utility class, follow the syntax of `UtilityName-value`. Utility classes should be
written in **pascal case**, similar to component classes, followed by its value in **camel case**.
Non-value utility classes are implementable which apply the default value of the utility class.

```html
<!-- Without value = base value -->
<div class="TextTransform">Use on its own</div>

<!-- Has a single value -->
<div class="FontWeight-bold">Has a single value</div>

<!-- Used in combination -->
<div class="Flex JustifyContent-end AlignItems-end">...</div>
```
