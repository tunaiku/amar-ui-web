## Installation

Amar UI Web can be installed via **package managers** like `yarn` or `npm`.

```bash
$ npm install @amar-ui-web/core
$ yarn add @amar-ui-web/core
```

## Usage

Upon installation, `@amar-ui-web/core` and all its underlying packages will be accessible from
inside your project's `node_modules` folder, but you might notice that **you're unable to access
them directly**. This is because you need to resolve your project's `node_modules` path first; each
package uses _absolute import_ to depend on each other using Sass' `@import`. If you haven't done
this, please follow the instructions in the
[Resolving `node_modules` Path section](#resolving-node_modules-path).

Once you're done, you should be able import the package like this:

```scss
@import '@amar-ui-web/core/index.scss';
```

If you would like to import individual packages/modules or its specific abstracts (variables,
mixins, functions, etc.), you can do that as well.

```scss
@import '@amar-ui-web/color/index.scss';
@import '@amar-ui-web/typography/index.scss';
```

```scss
/* import specific abstracts like variables, functions, mixins. */
@import '@amar-ui-web/color/scss/variables';
@import '@amar-ui-web/color/scss/mixins';
@import '@amar-ui-web/color/scss/functions';
```

To know more about each package/module features and APIs, please refer to each package
documentation.

## Resolving `node_modules` Path

### Webpack 4+

In your project's `webpack.config.js`, you need to include `node_modules` path inside of the
[`sassOptions.includePaths`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#includepaths) property in your
`sass-loader` options.

```js
module.exports = [{
  ...,
  rules: [
    ...,
    {
      loader: 'sass-loader',
      options: {
        ...,
        sassOptions: {
          includePaths: ['./node_modules']
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}]
```

### Angular 6+

In `angular.json` file, make sure the `node_modules` is listed as the `includePaths` under the
`build.options` configuration to enable the Sass compiler run properly.

```
{
  "build": {
    ...,
    "options": {
      ...,
      "styles": [
        "src/styles.scss"
      ],
      // add this line, just below "styles"
      "stylePreprocessorOptions": {
        "includePaths": ["node_modules/"]
      },
    }
  }
}
```

**_Note_**: _Don't forget to restart the `ng serve` after changing the `angular.json` file.
Otherwise, the new changes will not be applied._
