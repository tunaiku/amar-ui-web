## Installation

Amar UI Web can be installed by using package managers such as yarn and npm.

```shell
# Using npm
npm install @amar-ui-web/core

# Or using yarn
yarn add @amar-ui-web/core
```

Once installed, `@amar-ui-web/core`, simply import the package into your project's main entrypoint.
For example, say we have `styles.scss` as our main entrypoint.

```scss
// src/styles.scss
@import '@amar-ui-web/core';
```
