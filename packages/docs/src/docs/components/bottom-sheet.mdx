title: 'Bottom Sheet'
description: "A bottom sheet is a type of modal that is attached to the bottom of the viewport.
Much like dialogs, it covers the front of the primary content until it is
dismissed or confirmed, hence interruptive. Use bottom sheet to divert user's attention on an important
information."

## Usage

To implement a bottom sheet, first create a bottom sheet wrapper by appending `BottomSheet` class.
Then add `BottomSheet-dialog` and `BottomSheet-backdrop` as direct children.

- `BottomSheet` transforms an element into a bottom sheet wrapper.
- `BottomSheet-dialog` is where you can put any content inside.
- `BottomSheet-backdrop` creates a semi-transparent overlay that cover every view behind the backdrop and
  normally acts as the click target to dismiss the bottom sheet.

Here are some of the classes you can use inside of `BottomSheet-dialog`.

- `BottomSheet-media` is an **optional** block for additional illustrative media for visual aids.
- `BottomSheet-header` is typically used to present the title and description of the bottom sheet.
- `BottomSheet-body` is where you should put all vital information that you want to present.
- `BottomSheet-footer` is where you could normally put the call-to-action such as buttons or links.

```html preview=true bgColor=neutral.10 center=true
<div class="BottomSheet-dialog">
  <div class="BottomSheet-block PaddingTop-xlarge PaddingBottom-xlarge">
    <div class="Flex JustifyContent-center">
      <img

        style="width: 30%"
      />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="BottomSheet-block">
    <h5 class="Typography-heading20 MarginBottom-2xsmall">Selamat, Pinjaman Anda telah lunas!</h5>
    <p class="Color-neutral-80 MarginBottom">
      Terima kasih telah menggunakan pinjaman Tunaiku. Surat keterangan lunas akan dikirim ke alamat
      Anda.
    </p>
    <button class="Button Button--fullWidth Button--success">Ajukan Pinjaman Lagi</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Live Example

Here's a rough visualization of how a bottom sheet would look in a real-app view (see it in **Mobile View**
for the best experience).
