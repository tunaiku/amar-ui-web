## Installation

Amar UI Web can be installed by using **package managers** such as `yarn` and `npm`.

```shell
# Using npm
npm install @amar-ui-web/core

# Or using yarn
yarn add @amar-ui-web/core
```

## Resolve Sass Include Paths
Upon installation, `@amar-ui-web/core` and other `@amar-ui-web/*` package dependencies will be accessible from inside your project's `node_modules` directory, but you **cannot access them directly just yet**. You'll need to resolve `/node_modules` directory path first since `@amar-ui-web/core` uses *absolute import* to depend on its sub-packages using Sass' `@import`.

To do this, include the `/node_modules` directory into [include paths](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#includepaths) property in your preferred bundler (we recommend webpack). Otherwise, follow the below guidelines for more *framework-specific guides* to setup this part properly.

### Include Paths in Angular 6+
In `angular.json` file, make sure the `node_modules/` is listed as the `includePaths` under the `build.options` configuration to enable the Sass compiler run properly.
```json
{
  "build": {
    ...,
    "options": {
      ...,
      "styles": [
        "src/styles.scss"
      ], 
      // add this line, just below "styles"
      "stylePreprocessorOptions": {
        "includePaths": ["node_modules/"]
      },
    }
  }
}
```
***Note***: *Don't forget to restart the `ng serve` after changing the `angular.json` file. Otherwise, the new changes will not be applied.*

## Usage
Once you're done with the include paths, you can then proceed to import the `index.scss` of
`@amar-ui-web/core` into your project's style entrypoint.

```scss
// For example, styles.scss is our entrypoint.
@import '@amar-ui-web/core/index.scss';
```

You're done! Amar UI Web is now configured to be used in your application.
